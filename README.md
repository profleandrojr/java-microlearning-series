# Java Microlearning Series

Short, focused lessons designed to build strong mental models in Java — one concept at a time.

This project follows a **microlearning approach**:
- small lessons
- clear explanations
- real code
- no unnecessary tooling

The goal is not to teach “everything”, but to help learners understand **how Java actually works**.

---

## 📚 Structure

Each lesson lives in its own folder:

lessons/
01-string-immutability/
02-reference-vs-object/
03-string-pool/
...

Every lesson contains:
- a short README with the core idea
- a single `Main.java` file
- a focused practice scenario

---

## ▶️ How to run (recommended: local)

**Requirements**
- Java 21+ (or any modern Java version)

From a lesson folder:

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```

That’s it.
No Maven. No frameworks. No setup noise.

🧠 **Current lessons**

01 — String Immutability
Understanding why Strings don’t change — and what actually changes.

02 — Reference vs Object (coming next)

03 — String Pool (coming next)

More lessons will be added progressively.

🎯 **Teaching philosophy**

Concepts before syntax

References before frameworks

Mental models over memorization

Simple tools before complex stacks

This material is designed to complement short videos, carousels, and classroom discussions.
